# MovieLens Data Science Project

## Introduction

This project involves applying the knowledge from the Introduction to Data Science course at UFMG. For this, we chose the MovieLens movie set as the theme addressed.

[MovieLens](https://movielens.org/) is a platform to discover and learn more about your favorites movies. The platform is managed by [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/), a research group in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Minnesota, focused on recommender systems, online communities, mobile and ubiquitous technologies, libraries digital and local geographic information systems.

## Choosing the dataset

The chosen dataset was found on the kaggle platform. The dataset content contains data up to July 2017.
